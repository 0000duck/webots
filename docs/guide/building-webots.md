# Building Webots

As an alternative to simply [installing of a precompiled package](installing-webots.md), Webots can also be built from sources.

To do so, please refer to [the official Webots GitHub repository](https://github.com/omichel/webots) and more specifically to its [wiki](https://github.com/omichel/webots/wiki).
