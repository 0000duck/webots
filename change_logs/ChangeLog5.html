</ul>

<h2>Webots 5.5.0</h2>
Released on September 14th, 2007 (revision 518)

<p><b><font color="red">Warning about the Joint node and the "joint" field.</font></b>
In this version, the Joint node and the "joint" fields were completely removed in order to simplify the design of new robot models.
The usage of the Joint node was found to be confusing, because it was often unclear if a Joint node was required or not.
This version of Webots makes the appropriate decision automatically.
In addition, all the instances of Joint nodes were removed from all the .wtb example in Webots distribution.
When this version of Webots loads a .wbt file that contain Joint nodes it issues a error message similar to this:<br>
<pre>Error at line 979:
Unsupported field: 'joint' for 'Servo' node</pre>
You can safely ignore these error messages: then when you subsequently save the .wbt file, Webots automatically removes all the Joint nodes.
Therefore there will be no error message the next time you load the .wbt file.
</p>

<p><b><font color="red">Change in the Shrimp model.</font></b>
The "shrimp.wbt" model was slightly modified as a consequence of the removal of the Joint node.
In the previous "shrimp.wbt" model, an empty "joint" field in a Solid node used to indicate that this joint was going to be created in the physics plugin.
Now the same thing is indicated by a Servo node which "type" field constains the string "none".
<p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed sometimes not working "jump-to-error" behavior of compilation console (Mac OS X)</li>
<li>Fixed wrong collision detection when boundingObject had a "Group->Shape" structure and Physics.centerOfMass/rotation had non-default values</li>
<li>Fixed sometimes incomplete list of gcc error messages displayed in text editor (Windows)</li>
<li>Fixed problem when updating a lserv3 dongle from Windows</li>
<li>Added color-coded axis system for Connectors</li>
<li>Added rupture simulation for Connectors</li>
<li>Added "snap" mechanism to precisely adjust Connectors when they become "locked"</li>
<li>Fixed crash when deleting spine or crossSection items of an Extrusion</li>
<li>Fixed crash when saving a world for which a robot followed by the camera was deleted</li>
<li>Webots rendered cameras now work properly with Java controllers</li>
<li>Fixed crash when Color item of Background.skyColor is deleted</li>
<li>Fixed problem when WEBOTS_HOME points to a non-existent directory</li>
<li>Fixed bug with the setting of the java command in the preferences</li>

</ul>

<h2>Webots 5.4.0</h2>
Released on July 18th, 2007 (revision 369)

<p><b><font color="red">Warning about WorldInfo.basicTimeStep.</font></b>
In this version, Webots checks that the controller step (the value passed to robot_step() or returned by the controller's run() function) is a multiple of the basicTimeStep. Simulations that do not meet this requirement will issue warning messages.
</p>

<p><b><font color="red">Warning about servo_set_force() function.</font></b>
In this version, the existing servo_set_force() function was renamed servo_set_motor_force().
There is now a new servo_set_force() function with a different purpose, please refer to the Reference Manual for more info.
We recommend to replace any previous call to servo_set_force() by a call to servo_set_motor_force() in your controller code.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Webots can now run on the same machine as the lserv3</li>
<li>Added Robot.selfCollision field to enable intra-robot collision detection</li>

<li>Fixed defective use of the "controller" field as PROTO field</li>
<li>Propose to adapt translation and rotation when pasting a node at the parent's level in the scene tree window to preserve abolute position and orientation</li>

<li>Added new functions for motor torque/force feedback: servo_enable_motor_force_feedback() and servo_get_motor_force_feedback()</li>
<li>Added new servo_set_force() function in order to allow simplified force control of servos</li>
<li>Deprecated servo_motor_off() function (use servo_set_motor_force(servo, 0) instead)</li>
<li>Removed obsolete Servo fields: "customForce", "forceAndTorque" and "animation"</li>
<li>Removed obsolete Servo functions: servo_set_abs_force_and_torque(), servo_set_rel_force_and_torque(), servo_run_animation(), servo_get_animation_number() and servo_get_animation_range()</li>
<li>Fixed Makefile.openr in the ers-210 controller sample, so that it works with the new webots-openr package (with support for the Aibo camera)</li>
<li>Uses the MAC address of the Ethernet card on Mac OS X for the ComputerID</li>
<li>Fixed rounding problem in scheduler which sometimes caused physics_step() to be called too often (and eventually causes a drift in robot_get_time() with respect to the simulation time)</li>
<li>Added e-puck program uploader in the Tools menu</li>
</ul>

<h2>Webots 5.1.14</h2>
Released on May 21st, 2007 (revision 99)

<p><b><font color="red">Warning about LightSensors</font></b>
The lookupTable of LightSensor sometimes returned incorrect values in previous versions of Webots. This problem was fixed with this new release.
As a consequence the light_sensor_get_value() function might in some situation return values different than before, therefore simulations tuned for specific return values will need to be slightly adapted to work with this version.

</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Webots 5.1.13</h2>
Released on May 9th, 2007 (revision 69)

<p><b><font color="red">Warning about TouchSensors</font></b>
If TouchSensors were used, existing robot models developed for previous releases of Webots may have
to be slightly modified in order to work with this new version of Webots.
The new "force" TouchSensors are unidirectional while the old ones were omnidirectional.
The new "force" sensors measure the force along their z-axis, while the other axes are ignored.
The modification is very simple: the TouchSensors must be reoriented such that their positive z-axes point from the body outwards, in the direction where the force need to be measured (where the collision is expected to take place).
Please also note that the values returned by "bumper" sensors may also differ from those of previous Webots version because the new version returns fixed 0 or 1 while the previous version used to return the min or max values of the lookup table.
