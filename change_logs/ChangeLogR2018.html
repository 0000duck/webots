<li>Linux: fix application name shown in the system toolbar that could be wrong after multiple Webots installations.</li>
<li>Fixed wb_supervisor_node_set_visibility not working with lights (Thanks to Chansol).</li>
<li>Fixed IndexedFaseSet duplicated vertices error in "soccer.wbt" and "soccer_demo.wbt" in the "samples/demos" directory.</li>
<li>Fixed login dialog preventing users of a local license to login if not connected to the Internet.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect overlay resize behavior when moving horizontally.</li>
<li>Fixed shift-scrollwheel vertical translation events not being applied the first time the mouse wheel is rotated.</li>
<li>Fixed controller not started when the Robot is imported at first step and simulation is in step mode.</li>
<li>Display a warning during HTML5 export of worlds containing USE light nodes that are not supported by all the viewers.</li>
<li>Fixed automatic follow solid functionality in web streaming if a new world is loaded while the client is connected.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when the 'forceDependentSlip' field of a ContactProperties node is empty.</li>
<li>Fixed artifacts due to the spherical projection of the Camera, Lidar and RangeFinder nodes (thanks to Liam).</li>
<li>Fixed VRML97 import not copying textures over to the current project.</li>
<li>Fixed wrong collision detection when an ElevationGrid is used in a bounding object and the parent Solid is rotated.</li>
<li>Fixed bug affecting the friction of a track in a world with a gravity along the Z-axis (thanks to Matt).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where importing VRML97 files containing a WorldInfo node could break Viewpoint mouse navigation.</li>
<li>Fixed remote control and cross compilation on DARwIn-OP robot using an old DARwIn-OP Framework</li>
<li>Fixed the 'transparency' argument of the 'wb_supervisor_set_label' function which was affecting the color too (thanks to Inbae).</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Upgrade</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Windows: upgraded to Qt 5.10.0.</li>
<li>macOS: Upgraded to Qt 5.9.2.</li>
<li>Changed the template engine from slt2 to liluat.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Cleanup</b></li>
<ul>
<li><font color="red"><b>Dropped the deprecated Servo node.</b></font> A PROTO is now replacing the old Servo node.</li>
<li><font color="red"><b>Deprecated the DifferentialWheels node.</b></font> Please use the Robot node instead with two HingeJoint, RotationalMotor and PositionSensor nodes.</li>
<ul>
<li>All the PROTO files previously using a DifferentialWheels node (including the E-puck, Create, Khepera3 and Khepera4) have been updated to use a Robot node instead.</li>
<li>Robot windows of previously DifferentialWheels have been update to use standard units (radians/second for wheel velocities and radians for wheel positions).</li>
</ul>
