<h2>Webots 7.0.beta4</h2>
Released on September 27h, 2012 (revision 11557)
<ul>
<li>Modified the camera buffer format from RGB or RGBA to BGRA</li>
<li>Improved the GUI: use Qt instead of wxWigets</li>
<li>Improved the physics engine: use ode-0.12 instead of ode-0.11</li>
<li>Improved the IndexedFaceSet primitive: common structure for Ogre and ODE</li>
<li>Deprecated the Extrusion primitive</li>
<li>New item in the 'View > Optional Rendering': Show Center Of Mass and Support Polygon</li>
<li>New supervisor functions to retrieve contact points, centers of mass and to perform the support polygon static balance test</li>
<li>The magnitude of a user-defined force, or a user-defined torque, is displayed in the status bar</li>
<li>A new dialog box allows to find and load textures in a simple way</li>
<li>The notification of the collisions by a change in the color of bounding ojects is made at the level of each individual Geometry</li>
<li>The 'View > Follow Object' action is made more user-friendly and supports all run-time changes of the followed object caused by either the user or a supervisor</li>
<li>In physics plugins, users can now set their own data in ODE dGeom provided such data doesn't start with Webots' magic number</li>
<li>The default physics node automatically compute mass, intertia matrix and center of mass from the bounding object</li>
<li>All physics fields can be changed at run time</li>
<li>Scale fields are constrained to positive values</li>
<li>Transforms in bounding objects are now scalable</li>
<li>Solids are now scalable by any uniform factor</li>
<li>Cameras and Displays screens are both visible and resizable before the simulation starts</li>
<li>Fixed bug: the horizontal edges of a polygon drawn within a Display screen are now visible</li>
<li>Added Fullscreen mode for simulation and video recording</li>
<li>Improved Pen device: paint on any geometry and in any direction</li>
<li>Fixed compilation issue on the C++ wrapper (thanks to Tim)</li>
<li>Removed obsolete wb_supervisor_start_animation() and wb_supervisor_stop_animation() functions</li>
<li>Changed all API functions to return NaN (instead of -1.0 or 0.0) for any unitialized double value, e.g. before having called to wb_*_enable() and wb_robot_step().
<font color="red">In the controller main loop, it is now recommended to call wb_robot_step() <b>before</b> getting the sensor values.
Is not recommended to call wb_robot_step() <b>after</b> getting the sensor values.</font></li>
