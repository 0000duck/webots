# The Cubemap node specifies a cubic texture that can be used as an environment texture
# or for environmental reflections on Shape nodes with a PBRAppearance node.
# Cube textures are loaded by taking the textureBaseName field and adding the "_front",
# "_back", "_top", "_bottom", "_left" and "_right" suffixes to the base name to find
# the textures for each face.
